# Recipe Page

Thanks for checking out my repo.

This is my solution for the the Frontend Mentor - Recipe page challenge. You can checkout the challenge at [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) or go checkout the `frontend-mentor-challenge` branch from this repo.

The goal for this challenge is to create a page with focus on it semantic structure ensuring compatibility for screen readers or parsers.

HTML structure and element class naming have been designed to ensure as much modularity as possible so that you can simply copy and paste the needed section to another page while maintaining functionality/styling.
